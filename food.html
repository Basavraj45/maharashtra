        <p><br><br><mark><b>Shrikhand </b></mark>is a traditional and delicious <b>Maharashtrian dessert made from strained curd (yogurt), sweetened with sugar and flavored with cardamom, saffron, and dry fruits like almonds and pistachios.</b> The curd is hung in a cloth to remove all the water, resulting in a thick and creamy texture known as chakka. This is then blended with sugar and aromatic ingredients to create a rich and smooth dessert.
        Shrikhand is often served chilled and enjoyed with puri, especially during festivals and special occasions like Gudi Padwa or Janmashtami. There are also flavored versions like Amrakhand (with mango). Loved for its creamy consistency and refreshing taste, Shrikhand is a perfect blend of simplicity, tradition, and indulgence in Maharashtrian cuisine.
